									<aside class="notes"><ul style="font-size:16px;">><li>The meaning of the temple event both as a historical event, as a story in a particular narrative story has been hotly debated for many years. </li> <li>Before 1985 there was mostly scholarly concensus that this was a "cleansing" due largely to issues of purity within the temple although many acknowledge economic corruption was a motivation, with a few minor exceptions such as Brandon</li> <li>This began to become hotly debated after 1985 with the publication of "Jesus in Judaism by E.P. Sanders and as a result there currently basically only three schools of thought, it is slightly more complicated but basically there are 3 main categories.</li> </ul></aside>

							<section>
							<h2>Interpretation based on assumption</h2>
							<p>Many of the above scholarly papers and monographs make 2 implicit yet erroneous assumptions:<br/><br/></p>
							<ol>
								<li style="margin-bottom:35px;">The temple is solely a religious institution </li>
							<li>The sole purpose of the money-changers is to change all foreign currency into the Tyrian Shekel</li>
							</ol>
							<aside class="notes"></aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Importance of Money Changers</h2>
							<ul>
								<li style="margin-bottom:15px;">Many of these interpretations based on role of the “money-changers”</li>
									<ul>
										<li style="margin-bottom:15px;">Service vital to sacrifice/temple = Condemnation of the temple (Sanders)</li>
										<li style="margin-bottom:15px;">Just another trader who should be outside of the temple = “cleansing” the temple</li>
										<li style="margin-bottom:15px;">Overcharging/profit making for high priest = protest against corruption</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
							<aside class="notes"> <p style="font-size:16px;">on this last point it can be subdivided. For example Jeramias argues that it was ultimately the high priestly family that ultimately benefited the most and that protest was likely against the high priest. Others have argued that the money-changers themselves are the ones who are being protested against for their own corruption. </p></aside>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h2>Method</h2>
							<ul>
								<li style="margin-bottom:60px;">The social, economic, political roles of all characters within their historical context should be understood, before one can understand the meaning of a protest against them. </li>
								<li>Take the warnings of Chilton and Evans – Jesus’ protest must be looked at in light of other ancient protests </li>
							</ul>
							<aside class="notes"><p style="font-size:16px;">How I am going to proceed is to look at the socio-economic role context of the temple, and then the birdsellers and money-changers to understand what a protest against them might mean. Then I will look at other similar protests to provide a lens with which to view this one. </p></aside>
						</section>

						<section>
							<img src="http://dev.concordia.ab.ca/reveal.js/images/cleansing_eng.png" style="width:1200px;" /><aside class="notes"><p style="font-size:16px;">Now lets look at the temple event. 	When I look at this there are a few things we notice right off the bat. Matthew and Mark are verbatim on Money changers and and bird sellers. Mark add's an odd clause about not permitting anyone to carry anything. Luke omits all details of the protest. No mention of whom Jesus is protesting against. John adds a whip and sheep and oxen, but is clear Jesus' focus on bird-sellers and money-changers. I don't put much stock in the historicity of John </p></aside>

							<h2>Physical context – the Temple</h2>
							<h4>What role did the temple play in the lives of people?</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Religious centre</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Sacrifice, ritual</li>
									</ul>
								<li>Political centre</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Centre of propaganda (for Herod and for the high priests)</li>
									</ul>
								<li>Economic centre</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Centre of trade, storage of wealth, banking centre, debt creation for peasantry, wealth creation for high priestly family</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
							<aside class="notes"> <p style="font-size:16px;">The Jerusalem temple was the economic center of life in Judea.<br/><br/>"Fundamentaly an economic institution and dominated the city's commercial life." (Meyers 300, Jeremias 25-57)</p></aside>

								<h2>Temple economics</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Temple Tax - half-shekel </li>
									<li>Tithe - 10% of all crops in Judea</li>
									<li>sacrifice</li>
									<li>deposit</li>
									<li>Josephus <i>Ant.</i> 14.110</li>
									<li>Tacitus <i>Hist</i> 5.8.1</li>
								</ul>
								<aside class="notes"><p style="font-size:16px;"> Temple Tax - half-shekel (or doubledracma or two denarii) to be paid annually by every Jewish male over twenty years old, even Diaspora Jews<br/> For Judean peasants surviving at a subsistence level, one tenth of their crop was more than they could afford. The situation was not much better for Diaspora Jews, as Rome already took a percentage of their crop (usually around one quarter) and a tribute of 1 denarius per year.48 With Rome demanding a quarter of their crop every year and 1 denarius per year, the two denarii demanded by the temple, was more than most Diaspora Jews were able to pay. <br/> Josephus ant 13:110<br/> Tacitus states that Jerusalem “a temple possessing enormous riches.”</p></aside>

Allegedly in the first century the price had been raised to 1 gold dinar. “Shimon ben Gamliel said, “By this Temple! I will not sleep tonight until their price is [reduced to] a silver dinar.” He entered the court and instructed: “A woman who has five certain miscarriages or five certain cases of vaginal bleeding shall bring one sacrifice, eat from the sacrificial meat, and have no further liability.” That very day the price of pigeons fell to a fourth of [a silver dinar].” </p></aside>

                          		<aside class="notes"> <p style="font-size:16px;">Finally we get to the heart of the matter. What did money changers actually do. The simple answer is they exchanged foreign currency into the ritualistically pure Tyrian shekel required to pay the temple tax. This fact is repeated ad nauseum in every single commentary on Mark, Matthew and John. I think we can do a bit better. it is difficult to say anything illegent about money changers without understanding the larger context of banking in the ancient world </p></aside>
